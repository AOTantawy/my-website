## My story

In 2016, I wrote my first program in c++; right it was a simple program but it opened my eyes to a new world where the machine can do fascinating things since then I explored then fundamentals of computer science and dug deeper into them through learning more about data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming (OOP) after founding a good base of knowledge and skill the practical part came through actively using competitive programming websites like (Codeforces, HackerRank, and SPOJ ), and participating in programming competitions like ACM.

After gaining some knowledge and experience in programming; I started to explore web development by learning how the web works and building some websites from scratch, but life wasn't pinky all the time as I realized that web development is a large spectrum and I had to specialize in one thing so after lots of hustling I decided to deep dive in the back-end engineering.

As I explored many back-end programming languages -like Python, JavaScript- and frameworks -like Django, Node.js, and Express.js - I decided to continue with Java and Spring framework as my first choice, so currently I sharpen my Java and Spring skills then I will deep dive into some advanced topics like architecture patterns and database concepts to build a good reputation in the tech industry.
