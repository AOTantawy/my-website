## My story

In 2016 I started my career after joining the faculty of computers and information system Cairo University; back in this
time I have been introduced to some of the programming languages like c++, java, and python and also deep dive into
fundamental concepts like data structures, algorithms, OOP, and much more, after gaining some experience in programming
in general and competitive programming in particular, I participate in ACM (programming competition).

The second milestone in my career path was when I decided to learn web development, so after capturing some core
concepts like client/server architecture, Protocols, and APIs, then I learned different languages and frameworks like
Node.js Express.js and Python Django those for web services while for database servers I used SQL databases like MYSQL
and NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

Currently, I develop some projects to sharpen my skills and read more about architecture, and later I will dive into OOD
and design patterns.
